# coding-events

The purpose of this application is to create and manage details on coding events in the area. Users can freely display information on events they are holding for others to browse through multiple methods.

As of right now the application supports creating events with a name, a category, tags, and contact info for the event. Users can also create new tags and categories if none of the existing one fit the event they are putting on.

We are looking to add functionality to allow users to create account and then follow events including adding them to their personal calendars.
